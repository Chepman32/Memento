4. Detailed Screen Specifications

4.1 Splash Screen

Purpose: Brand introduction with spectacular physics-based animation

Visual Design:

Full-screen immersive canvas

Background: Dynamic gradient that shifts based on time of day

Morning (6-12): Soft blues transitioning to warm whites

Afternoon (12-18): Bright whites to golden yellows

Evening (18-24): Deep purples to navy blues

Night (0-6): Dark navy to black with star particles

Animation Options (randomly selected):

Option A: Physics Logo Breakdown

Logo composed of 50-100 geometric fragments (triangles, polygons)

Each fragment has physics properties:

Mass: varying weights

Initial velocity: explosive outward force

Rotation: random angular velocity

Gravity: pulls fragments down after explosion

Animation sequence:

0-800ms: Fragments explode from center with staggered timing (spring physics)

800-1500ms: Fragments reach apex, begin falling

1500-2300ms: Fragments reassemble into complete logo with magnetic attraction effect

2300-2800ms: Logo solidifies with scale bounce (spring config: damping 8, stiffness 120)

2800-3200ms: Fade transition to home screen

Option B: Rapidly Twisting Text

"MEMENTO" letters as individual Skia paths

Animation sequence:

0-600ms: Each letter spirals in from random positions (3D rotation on X, Y, Z axes)

600-1200ms: Letters twist rapidly (360° rotation per 200ms, motion blur effect)

1200-1800ms: Letters align into readable word with elastic snap

1800-2400ms: Word pulses with gradient color shift (hue rotation 0-360°)

2400-2800ms: Scale down with trailing particles effect

2800-3200ms: Crossfade to home screen

Technical Implementation:

react-native-skia Canvas

Skia Shaders for gradient effects

Reanimated shared values for physics calculations

worklet functions for 60fps performance

Particle system using Skia Paths

Custom easing curves: cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55)

6. Animation System

Core Animation Library

Reanimated Configurations:

const springConfig = {   damping: 15,   stiffness: 150,   mass: 1, };  const bouncySpring = {   damping: 8,   stiffness: 120,   mass: 0.8, };  const smoothSpring = {   damping: 20,   stiffness: 180,   mass: 1, }; 

Skia Animation Patterns

Logo Breakdown Physics:

Each fragment has:

Initial position: Center

Random velocity: vector(random(-500, 500), random(-500, 500))

Gravity: 9.8 units/s²

Rotation velocity: random(-360, 360) degrees/s

Color: Theme primary

Simulation runs for 2000ms

Reassembly uses magnetic attraction: force = k / distance²

Transition Effects Implementation:

Fade Transition:

Current photo opacity: 1 → 0

Next photo opacity: 0 → 1

Timing: linear, 500ms

Slide Transition:

Current photo translateX: 0 → -screenWidth

Next photo translateX: screenWidth → 0

Timing: easeInOut, 600ms

Zoom Transition:

Current photo scale: 1 → 2, opacity: 1 → 0

Next photo scale: 0.5 → 1, opacity: 0 → 1

Timing: easeOut, 700ms

Cube 3D Transition:

Both photos on 3D cube faces

Cube rotateY: 0 → 90° (current out)

Cube rotateY: 90° → 180° (next in)

Perspective: 1000

Timing: easeInOut, 800ms

Particle Dissolve:

Current photo: Divide into 100x100 pixel particles

Each particle:

Fades out: opacity 1 → 0

Translates randomly: ±50 units

Rotates: random(-45, 45)°

Particles dissolve with stagger (10ms per particle)

Next photo fades in after 70% dissolve complete

Gesture-Driven Animations

Swipe to Delete:

PanGestureHandler tracks translateX

Item follows finger with resistance

Background color interpolates: theme → red

Delete icon scales in from 0 → 1

Release:

If translationX > 120pt: Animate off-screen and delete

Else: Spring back to 0

Drag to Reorder:

LongPressGestureHandler activates

Item lifts: scale 1.08, shadow increases

Other items shift to make space (spring animation)

Drop: Item settles in new position with bounce

Pull to Refresh:

ScrollView onScroll monitors scrollY

When scrollY < -80: Activate loading

Custom Skia loader:

Circular arc that grows (0° → 360°)

Stroke width pulses (4pt → 8pt → 4pt)

Rotation animation (0° → 360°, 1000ms linear, repeat)

Micro-Interactions

Button Press:

Scale down: 1.0 → 0.95 (100ms, easeOut)

Haptic: Light impact

Release: 0.95 → 1.0 (150ms, spring)

Toggle Switch:

Thumb translateX: 0 → 20pt

Background color morph: gray → theme primary

Scale pulse on state change: 1.0 → 1.15 → 1.0

Duration: 200ms total

Haptic: Medium impact on state change

Card Hover (on long-press):

Scale: 1.0 → 1.05

Shadow elevation: 4 → 12

Duration: 200ms

Easing: easeOut

Loading States:

Spinner: Rotation 0° → 360° (800ms linear, repeat)

12. Video/GIF Generation

Video Export Pipeline

Step 1: Preparation:

Calculate total duration

Determine output resolution

Configure encoder settings

Create temporary working directory

Step 2: Frame Generation:

For each photo:

Load image at target resolution

Apply effects (color grading, filters)

Render with current transition

Generate frames for duration (24/30/60 fps)

Use react-native-skia for effects rendering

Maintain aspect ratio with letterboxing if needed

Step 3: Transition Rendering:

Generate transition frames between photos

Interpolate based on transition type

Typically 30-60 frames per transition (1-2 seconds)

Render effects on GPU where possible

Step 4: Audio Processing (if music added):

Load music file

Trim to slideshow duration

Apply fade in/out (1 second each)

Mix audio track

Step 5: Encoding:

Use ffmpeg-kit-react-native

H.264 codec for video

AAC codec for audio

Variable bitrate based on quality setting

Fast start for streaming

Configuration:

720p: ~2 Mbps

1080p: ~5 Mbps

4K: ~20 Mbps

Step 6: Finalization:

Move encoded file to final location

Generate thumbnail

Update project with export path

Clean temporary files

Trigger success callback

GIF Export Pipeline

Step 1: Optimization:

Reduce resolution (max 1080px width)

Limit colors (256 color palette)

Apply dithering if optimization enabled

Target: <10MB file size

Step 2: Frame Extraction:

Generate frames at 10fps (optimal for GIF)

Apply effects per photo

Render transitions

Step 3: GIF Creation:

Use react-native-gif-creator or gifski

Configure:

Frame delay: 100ms (10fps)

Loop: Infinite

Disposal method: Background

Compress with optimal quality

Step 4: Size Check:

If size > 10MB, warn user

Offer re-export with lower quality

Or split into multiple GIFs

Performance Optimizations

Rendering:

Use hardware acceleration (Metal on iOS)

Batch frame generation

Reuse Skia contexts

Cancel ongoing exports on screen dismissal

Memory Management:

Stream processing (don't load all frames in memory)

Clean up after each photo rendered

Use AutoreleasePool on iOS

Monitor memory warnings

Progress Reporting:

Update progress every frame batch

Calculate estimated time remaining

Throttle UI updates (max 30fps)

Send haptic at milestones (25%, 50%, 75%)
